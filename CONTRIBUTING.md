# Contributing
A (very informal, and) general guide for contributing to this project.

1. Fork this repository. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository with `git clone <repo>`. You should now have a local copy on your computer.
3. Create and switch to a new branch:
   ```sh
   git branch <branchname>    # create new branch
   git checkout <branchname>  # switch to new branch
   ```
   Recommended branch name: Your VIVA question number like `q1`, `q6`, etc.
4. Write code haha.
5. Add changes to staging area with `git add`. (Hint: `git status` is very helpful)
6. Commit changes with `git commit`.
7. Push your changes with `git push origin <branchname>`.
8. Go to your forked repo page, open a pull request, fill in neccessary information and detail.

Before pushing changes, please make sure that:
1. Your forked repo is up to date. Search for "sync fork" button on your forked GitHub repo page.
2. You have ran `git pull` to make sure your local repo is up to date.

Conflicts might appear if you forgot keeping either your remote fork repo or local repo up to date before you try to push new changes.

If you do mess up and you've done Googling but still cannot fix the issue, reach out and discuss with other group mates.
